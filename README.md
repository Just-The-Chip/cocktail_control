# cocktail_control
Raspberry Pi code to control an automatic cocktail dispenser

# What it will do
This code will display a scrollable list of cocktails from the database that you can scroll through by turning a rotary knob. Once you have a drink selected, you will be able to press a button and the machine will automatically dispense the drink for you according to the recipe in the database.

# Current progress
We are using Kivy for the UI. Right now you can either click on a drink from the list directly or click on the "SCROLL UP" or "SCROLL DOWN" buttons to select the next or previous drink, which will simulate what happens when you turn the knob. Upon selecting a cocktail, the image of the cocktail will show up to the left of the list.
